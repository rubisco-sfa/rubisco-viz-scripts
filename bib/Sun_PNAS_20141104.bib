 abstract	= {In C3 plants, CO$_2$ concentrations drop considerably along mesophyll diffusion pathways from substomatal cavities to chloroplasts where CO$_2$ assimilation occurs. Global carbon cycle models have not explicitly represented this internal drawdown and therefore overestimate CO$_2$ available for carboxylation and underestimate photosynthetic responsiveness to atmospheric CO$_2$. An explicit consideration of mesophyll diffusion increases the modeled cumulative CO$_2$ fertilization effect (CFE) for global gross primary production (GPP) from 915 to 1,057~PgC for the period of 1901--2010. This increase represents a 16\% correction, which is large enough to explain the persistent overestimation of growth rates of historical atmospheric CO$_2$ by Earth system models. Without this correction, the CFE for global GPP is underestimated by 0.05~PgC/y/ppm. This finding implies that the contemporary terrestrial biosphere is more CO$_2$ limited than previously thought.}
