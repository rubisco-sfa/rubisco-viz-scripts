 abstract	= {This study investigates the response of the global mean and spatial variations of the $delta^{18}$O value of atmospheric CO$_2$ ($delta C_a$) to changes in soil CO$_2$ hydration rates, relative humidity, the $delta^{18}$O value of precipitation and water vapor, visible radiation, temperature, and ecosystem flux partitioning. A three-dimensional global transport model was coupled to a mechanistic land surface model and was used to calculate isotopic fluxes of CO$_2$ and H$_2$O and the resulting $delta C_a$. The model reproduced the observed global mean and north-south gradient in $delta C_a$. The simulated seasonal amplitude and phases of CO$_2$ and $delta C_a$ agreed well at some but not all locations. Sensitivity tests with relative humidity increased by 3.2\% from its original value decreased $delta C_a$ by 0.21\permil. Similarly, a global 3.3\permil decrease in the isotopic composition of both precipitation and water vapor ($delta W_P$ and $delta W_{AV}$, respectively) caused a 2.6\permil decrease in $delta C_a$. A 1~K increase in atmospheric temperatures also affected $delta C_a$, but there was a very small $delta C_a$ response to realistic changes in light levels. Experiments where leaf and soil CO$_2$ fluxes were repartitioned revealed a nontrivial change to $delta C_a$. The predicted north-south $delta C_a$ gradient increased in response to an increase in soil CO$_2$ hydration rates. However, the $delta C_a$ gradient also had a large response to global changes in $delta W_P$ and $delta W_{AV}$. This result is particularly important since most models fail to deplete $delta W_P$ enough at middle and high latitudes, where the influence of $delta W_P$ and $delta W_{AV}$ on the $delta C_a$ gradient is strongest.}
