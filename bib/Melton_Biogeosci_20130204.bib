 abstract	= {Four major conclusions emerged from the project. First, the suite of models demonstrate extensive disagreement in their simulations of wetland areal extent and CH$_4$ emissions, in both space and time. Simple metrics of wetland area, such as the latitudinal gradient, show large variability, principally between models that use inundation dataset information and those that independently determine wetland area. Agreement between the models improves for zonally summed CH$_4$ emissions, but large variation between the models remains. For annual global CH$_4$ emissions, the models vary by $\pm$40\% of the all-model mean (190~Tg\,CH$_4$\,yr$^{-1}$). Second, all models show a strong positive response to increased atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations (857~ppm) in both CH$_4$ emissions and wetland area. In response to increasing global temperatures (+3.4$^\circ$C globally spatially uniform), on average, the models decreased wetland area and CH$_4$ fluxes, primarily in the tropics, but the magnitude and sign of the response varied greatly. Models were least sensitive to increased global precipitation (+3.9\% globally spatially uniform) with a consistent small positive response in CH$_4$ fluxes and wetland area. Results from the 20th century transient simulation show that interactions between climate forcings could have strong non-linear effects. Third, we presently do not have sufficient wetland methane observation datasets adequate to evaluate model fluxes at a spatial scale comparable to model grid cells (commonly 0.5$^\circ$). This limitation severely restricts our ability to model global wetland CH$_4$ emissions with confidence. Our simulated wetland extents are also difficult to evaluate due to extensive disagreements between wetland mapping and remotely sensed inundation datasets. Fourth, the large range in predicted CH$_4$ emission rates leads to the conclusion that there is both substantial parameter and structural uncertainty in large-scale CH$_4$ emission models, even after uncertainties in wetland areas are accounted for.}
