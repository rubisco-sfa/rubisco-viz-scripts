 abstract	= {Clarifying how increased atmospheric CO$_2$ concentration (eCO$_2$) contributes to accelerated land carbon sequestration remains important since this process is the largest negative feedback in the coupled carbon--climate system. Here, we constrain the sensitivity of the terrestrial carbon sink to eCO$_2$ over the temperate Northern Hemisphere for the past five decades, using 12 terrestrial ecosystem models and data from seven CO$_2$ enrichment experiments. This constraint uses the heuristic finding that the northern temperate carbon sink sensitivity to eCO$_2$ is linearly related to the site-scale sensitivity across the models. The emerging data-constrained eCO$_2$ sensitivity is $0.64 \pm 0.28$~PgC\,yr$^{-1}$ per hundred ppm of eCO$_2$. Extrapolating worldwide, this northern temperate sensitivity projects the global terrestrial carbon sink to increase by $3.5 \pm 1.9$~PgC\,yr$^{-1}$ for an increase in CO$_2$ of 100~ppm. This value suggests that CO$_2$ fertilization alone explains most of the observed increase in global land carbon sink since the 1960s. More CO$_2$ enrichment experiments, particularly in boreal, arctic and tropical ecosystems, are required to explain further the responsible processes.}
