 abstract	= {Climate change is altering vegetation and disturbance dynamics in boreal ecosystems. However, the aggregate impact of these changes on boreal carbon budgets is not well understood. Here we combined multiple satellite datasets to estimate annual stocks and changes in aboveground biomass (AGB) across boreal northwestern North America. From 1984 to 2014, the $2.82 \times 106$~km$^2$ study region gained $434 \pm 176$~Tg of AGB. Fires resulted in losses of $789 \pm 48$~Tg, which were mostly compensated by post-fire recovery of $642 \pm 86$~Tg. Timber harvests contributed to losses of $74 \pm 5$~Tg, which were partly offset by post-harvest recovery of $32 \pm 9$~Tg. Earth system models overestimated AGB accumulation by a factor of 3 ($+1,519 \pm 171$~Tg), which suggests that these models overestimate the terrestrial carbon sink in boreal ecosystems and highlights the need to improve representation of fire and other disturbance processes in these models.}
