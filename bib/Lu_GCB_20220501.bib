 abstract	= {The length of the growing season has a large influence on the carbon, water, and energy fluxes of global terrestrial ecosystems. While there has been mounting evidence of an advanced start of the growing season mostly due to elevated spring air temperatures, the mechanisms that control the end of the growing season (EOS) in most ecosystems remain relatively less well understood. Recently, a strong lagged control of EOS by growing season photosynthesis has been proposed, suggesting that more productive growing seasons lead to an earlier EOS. However, this relationship has not been extensively tested with in-situ observations across a variety of ecosystems. Here, we use observations from 40 eddy-covariance flux tower sites in temperate and boreal ecosystems in the northern hemisphere with more than 10 years of observations (594 site-years), ground observations of phenology, satellite observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and three leaf senescence models to test the extent of a relationship between growing season photosynthesis and end of season senescence. The results suggest that there is no significant negative relationship between growing season photosynthesis and observed leaf senescence, flux-inferred EOS estimates, or remotely sensed phenological metrics, in most ecosystems. On the contrary, while we found negative effects of summer air temperatures and autumn vapor pressure deficit on EOS, more productive growing seasons were typically related to a later, not earlier, EOS. Our results challenge recent reports of carry-over effects of photosynthesis on EOS timing, and suggest those results may not hold over a large range of ecosystems.}
