 abstract	= {The amplitude of the mean annual cycle of atmospheric CO$_2$ is a diagnostic of seasonal surface--atmosphere carbon exchange. Atmospheric observations show that this quantity has increased over most of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropics during the last 3 decades, likely from a combination of enhanced atmospheric CO$_2$, climate change, and anthropogenic land use change. Accurate climate prediction requires accounting for long-term interactions between the environment and carbon cycling; thus, analysis of the evolution of the mean annual cycle in a fully prognostic Earth system model may provide insight into the multi-decadal influence of environmental change on the carbon cycle.

We analyzed the evolution of the mean annual cycle in atmospheric CO$_2$ simulated by the Community Earth System Model (CESM) from 1950 to 2300 under three scenarios designed to separate the effects of climate change, atmospheric CO$_2$ fertilization, and land use change. The NH CO$_2$ seasonal amplitude increase in the CESM mainly reflected enhanced primary productivity during the growing season due to climate change and the combined effects of CO$_2$ fertilization and nitrogen deposition over the mid- and high latitudes. However, the simulations revealed shifts in key climate drivers of the atmospheric CO$_2$ seasonality that were not apparent before 2100. CO$_2$ fertilization and nitrogen deposition in boreal and temperate ecosystems were the largest contributors to mean annual cycle amplification over the midlatitudes for the duration of the simulation (1950--2300). Climate change from boreal ecosystems was the main driver of Arctic CO$_2$ annual cycle amplification between 1950 and 2100, but CO$_2$ fertilization had a stronger effect on the Arctic CO$_2$ annual cycle amplitude during 2100--2300. Prior to 2100, the NH CO$_2$ annual cycle amplitude increased in conjunction with an increase in the NH land carbon sink. However, these trends decoupled after 2100, underscoring that an increasing atmospheric CO$_2$ annual cycle amplitude does not necessarily imply a strengthened terrestrial carbon sink.}
