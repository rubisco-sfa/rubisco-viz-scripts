 abstract	= {The ongoing development of the Global Carbon Project (GCP) global methane (CH$_4$) budget shows a continuation of increasing CH$_4$ emissions and CH$_4$ accumulation in the atmosphere over 2000--2017. Here we decompose the global budget into 19 regions (18 land and one oceanic) and five key source sectors to spatially attribute the observed global trends. A comparison of top-down (atmospheric and transport model-based) and bottom-up (inventory- and process model-based) CH$_4$ emissions estimates demonstrates robust temporal trends with CH$_4$ emissions increasing in 16 of the 19 regions. Five regions - China, Southeast Asia, USA, South Asia, and Brazil - account for $>$40\% of the global total emissions (their anthropogenic and natural sources together totalling $>$270~Tg\,CH$_4$\,yr$^{-1}$ in 2008--2017). Two of these regions, China and South Asia, emit predominantly anthropogenic emissions ($>$75\%) and together emit more than 25\% of global anthropogenic emissions. China and the Middle East show the largest increases in total emission rates over the 2000 to 2017 period with regional emissions increasing by $>$20\%. In contrast, Europe and Korea \& Japan, show a steady decline in CH$_4$ emission rates, with total emissions decreasing by $\sim$10\% between 2000 and 2017. Coal mining, waste (predominantly solid waste disposal) and livestock (especially enteric fermentation) are dominant drivers of observed emissions increases while declines appear driven by a combination of waste and fossil emission reductions. As such, together these sectors present the greatest risks of further increasing the atmospheric CH$_4$ burden and the greatest opportunities for greenhouse gas abatement.}
