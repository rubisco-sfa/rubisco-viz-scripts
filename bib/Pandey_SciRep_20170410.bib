 abstract	= {Year-to-year variations in the atmospheric methane (CH$_4$) growth rate show significant correlation with climatic drivers. The second half of 2010 and the first half of 2011 experienced the strongest La Ni\~{n}a since the early 1980s, when global surface networks started monitoring atmospheric CH$_4$ mole fractions. We use these surface measurements, retrievals of column-averaged CH$_4$ mole fractions from GOSAT, new wetland inundation estimates, and atmospheric $\delta^{13}$C-CH$_4$ measurements to estimate the impact of this strong La Ni\~{n}a on the global atmospheric CH$_4$ budget. By performing atmospheric inversions, we find evidence of an increase in tropical CH$_4$ emissions of $\sim$6--9~Tg\,CH$_4$\,yr$^{-1}$ during this event. Stable isotope data suggest that biogenic sources are the cause of this emission increase. We find a simultaneous expansion of wetland area, driven by the excess precipitation over the Tropical continents during the La Ni\~{n}a. Two process-based wetland models predict increases in wetland area consistent with observationally-constrained values, but substantially smaller per-area CH$_4$ emissions, highlighting the need for improvements in such models. Overall, tropical wetland emissions during the strong La Ni\~{n}a were at least by 5\% larger than the long-term mean.}
