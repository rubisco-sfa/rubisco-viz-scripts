 abstract	= {The effects of phosphorus (P) availability on carbon (C) cycling in the Amazon region are investigated using CLM-CNP. We demonstrate that the coupling of P dynamics reduces the simulated historical terrestrial C sink due to increasing atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations ([CO$_2$]) by about 26\%. Our exploratory simulations show that the response of tropical forest C cycling to increasing [CO$_2$] depends on how elevated CO$_2$ affects phosphatase enzyme production. The effects of warming are more complex, depending on the interactions between humidity, C and nutrient dynamics. While a simulation with low humidity generally shows the reduction of NPP, a second simulation with higher humidity suggests overall increases in NPP due to the dominant effects of reduced water stress and more nutrient availability. Our simulations point to the need for: 1) new observations on how elevated [CO$_2$] affects phosphatase enzyme production; 2) more tropical leaf-scale measurements under different temperature/humidity conditions with different soil P availability.}
