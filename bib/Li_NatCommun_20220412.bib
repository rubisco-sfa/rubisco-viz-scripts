 abstract	= {Biophysical effects from deforestation have the potential to amplify carbon losses but are often neglected in carbon accounting systems. Here we use both Earth system model simulations and satellite-derived estimates of aboveground biomass to assess losses of vegetation carbon caused by the influence of tropical deforestation on regional climate across different continents. In the Amazon, warming and drying arising from deforestation result in an additional $5.1 \pm 3.7$\% loss of aboveground biomass. Biophysical effects also amplify carbon losses in the Congo ($3.8 \pm 2.5$\%) but do not lead to significant additional carbon losses in tropical Asia due to its high levels of annual mean precipitation. These findings indicate that tropical forests may be undervalued in carbon accounting systems that neglect climate feedbacks from surface biophysical changes and that the positive carbon--climate feedback from deforestation-driven climate change is higher than the feedback originating from fossil fuel emissions.}
