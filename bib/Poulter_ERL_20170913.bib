 absract	= {Increasing atmospheric methane (CH$_4$) concentrations have contributed to approximately 20\% of anthropogenic climate change. Despite the importance of CH$_4$ as a greenhouse gas, its atmospheric growth rate and dynamics over the past two decades, which include a stabilization period (1999--2006), followed by renewed growth starting in 2007, remain poorly understood. We provide an updated estimate of CH$_4$ emissions from wetlands, the largest natural global CH$_4$ source, for 2000--2012 using an ensemble of biogeochemical models constrained with remote sensing surface inundation and inventory-based wetland area data. Between 2000--2012, boreal wetland CH$_4$ emissions increased by $1.2$~Tg\,yr$^{-1}$ ($-0.2--3.5$~Tg\,yr$^{-1}$), tropical emissions decreased by $0.9$~Tg\,yr$^{-1}$ ($-3.2--1.1$~Tg\,yr$^{-1}$), yet globally, emissions remained unchanged at $184 \pm 22$~Tg\,yr$^{-1}$. Changing air temperature was responsible for increasing high-latitude emissions whereas declines in low-latitude wetland area decreased tropical emissions; both dynamics are consistent with features of predicted centennial-scale climate change impacts on wetland CH$_4$ emissions. Despite uncertainties in wetland area mapping, our study shows that global wetland CH$_4$ emissions have not contributed significantly to the period of renewed atmospheric CH$_4$ growth, and is consistent with findings from studies that indicate some combination of increasing fossil fuel and agriculture-related CH$_4$ emissions, and a decrease in the atmospheric oxidative sink.}
