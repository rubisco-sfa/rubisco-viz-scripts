 abstract	= {Aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been shown to influence the global carbon sink by increasing the fraction of diffuse light, which increases photosynthesis over a greater fraction of the vegetated canopy. Between 1995 and 2013, U.S. SO$_2$ emissions declined by over 70\%, coinciding with observed AOD reductions of $3.0 \pm 0.6$\%\,yr$^{-1}$ over the eastern U.S. In the Community Earth System Model (CESM), these trends cause diffuse light to decrease regionally by almost 0.6\%\,yr$^{-1}$, leading to declines in gross primary production (GPP) of 0.07\%\,yr$^{-1}$. Integrated over the analysis period and domain, this represents 0.5~Pg\,C of omitted GPP. A separate upscaling calculation that used published relationships between GPP and diffuse light agreed with the CESM model results within 20\%. The agreement between simulated and data-constrained upscaling results strongly suggests that anthropogenic sulfate trends have a small impact on carbon uptake in temperate forests due to scattered light.}
