 abstract	= {Many climate models from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project predict decreases in precipitation in Central America and northern South America by the year 2100 for the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario. Here we show that the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models able to more accurately simulate warm North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs) for the present climate (strong Atlantic meridional overturning circulation models) are more likely to project a larger precipitation decrease. Drought amplification from the slowdown of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation is more significant during the wet season in the Northern Hemisphere, with an SST-constrained model estimate yielding a 73\% larger decrease in precipitation ($-1.11$~mm/day) than the multimodel mean ($-0.64$~mm/day). Since most Earth system models underestimate contemporary SSTs in the North Atlantic, the use of the multimodel mean for impact analysis likely underestimates drought stress and the vulnerability of neotropical forests to increasing drought from climate change.}
