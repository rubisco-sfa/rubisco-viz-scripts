 abstract	= {The global increase in atmospheric CO$_2$ since the preindustrial era has not been accompanied by a long-term trend in the CO$^{18}$O/CO$_2$ ratio (denoted as $\delta C_a$), though many monitoring stations around the world observed a downward excursion in $\delta C_a$ (of about 0.1\permil\,y$^{-1}$) after 1992/1993 that lasted for 5--6 years. A number of studies have suggested that the interannual variation, seasonal cycle, and spatial structure of $\delta C_a$ depend on terrestrial ecosystem fluxes. The $\delta C_a$ budget is evaluated to identify meteorological variables that could potentially influence the observed interannual $\delta C_a$ variations. Using global data sets, time series of relative humidity, $^{18}$O composition of precipitation ($\delta W_P$), air temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation were correlated with Mauna Loa $\delta C_a$ variations. Observed $\delta C_a$ negatively correlated with relative humidity in tropical and middle- and high-latitude regions, and we estimated that observed relative humidity variations drove a 0.14\permil decrease in $\delta C_a$ during the mid-1990s. Similar variations in precipitation rates were also found within the tropics that suggest positive correlations between $\delta W_P$ and $\delta C_a$ consistent with an amount effect ($\delta W_P$ decreases as precipitation increases). The decrease in $\delta W_P$ during the 1990s was estimated to decrease $\delta C_a$ by as much as 0.48\permil. In contrast to previous work, little evidence was found that would suggest carbon flux anomalies as the primary driver of interannual $\delta C_a$ variations. We conclude that interannual $\delta C_a$ variations were driven primarily by isotope hydrology and relative humidity, and that $\delta C_a$ can be exploited as a new constraint on hydrological cycle variations at a variety of scales.}
