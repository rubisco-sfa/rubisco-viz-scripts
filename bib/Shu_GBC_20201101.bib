 abstract	= {We developed vertically-resolved soil biogeochemistry (carbon and nitrogen) module and implemented it into a land surface model, ISAM. The model captures the vertical heterogeneity of the Northern High Latitudes permafrost soil organic carbon (SOC). We also implemented $\Delta^{14}$C to estimate SOC turnover time, a critical determinant of SOC stocks, sequestration potential and the carbon cycle feedback under changing atmospheric CO$_2$ concentration [CO$_2$] and climate. ISAM accounted for the vertical movement of SOC caused by cryoturbation and its linkage to frost heaving process, oxygen availability, organo-mineral interaction and, depth-dependent environmental modifiers. After evaluating the model processes using the site and regional level heterotrophic respiration, SOC stocks and soil Î”$\Delta^{14}$ profiles, the vertically-resolved soil biogeochemistry version of the model (ISAM-1D) estimated permafrost SOC turnover time of 1443 years, which is about three times more than the estimation based on the without vertically-resolved version of ISAM (ISAM-0D). ISAM-1D simulated SOC stocks for permafrost regions was 319~PgC in the top 1 m soil depth by the 2000s, about 80\% higher than the estimates based on ISAM-0D. ISAM-1D SOC stock and turnover time were compared well with the observations. However, the longer SOC turnover time preserves less SOC stocks due to the lower carbon use efficiency (CUE) for SOC than ISAM-0D, thus respires more SOC than being transferred downward by cryoturbation. ISAM-1D simulated reduced SOC sequestration (3.7~PgC) compared to ISAM-0D (4.8~PgC) and published ESMs over 1860s-2000s, due to weaker [CO$_2$]-carbon cycle and stronger climate-carbon cycle feedbacks, highlighting the importance of the vertically heterogeneous soil for understanding the permafrost SOC sinks.}
