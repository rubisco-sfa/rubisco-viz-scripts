 abstract	= {We evaluated global soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and turnover time predictions from a global land model (ELMv1-ECA) integrated in an Earth System Model (E3SM) by comparing them with observed soil bulk and $\Delta^{14}$C values around the world. We analyzed observed and simulated SOC stocks and $\Delta^{14}$C values using machine learning methods at the Earth System Model grid cell scale ($\sim$200~km). In grid cells with sufficient observations, the model provided reasonable estimates of soil carbon stocks across soil depth and $\Delta^{14}$C values near the surface but underestimated $\Delta^{14}$C at depth. Among many explanatory variables, soil albedo index, soil order, plant function type, air temperature, and SOC content were major factors affecting predicted SOC $\Delta^{14}$C values. The influences of soil albedo index, soil order, and air temperature were primarily important in the shallow subsurface ($\le$30~cm). We also performed sensitivity studies using different vertical root distributions and decomposition turnover times and compared to observed SOC stock and $\Delta^{14}$C profiles. The analyses support the role of vegetation in affecting soil carbon turnover, particularly in deep soil, possibly through supplying fresh carbon and degrading physical-chemical protection of SOC via root activities. Allowing for grid cell-specific rooting and decomposition rates substantially reduced discrepancies between observed and predicted $\Delta^{14}$C values and SOC content. Our results highlight the need for more explicit representation of roots, microbes, and soil physical protection in land models.}
