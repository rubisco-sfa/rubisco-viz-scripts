 abstract	= {Carbon and nutrient dynamics in aquatic systems often emerge as the result of hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological interactions. Due to the multiscale and multidisciplinary nature of these process interactions, research into aquatic carbon and nutrient dynamics is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary. The motivation for this special issue came from an international workshop titled ``Hydro-Biogeochemical Processes: Mechanisms, Coupling, and Impact,'' which took place from 27 to 31 October 2015 at China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China. During this workshop, scientists from various countries and disciplines met to discuss current work and future advances on topics such as the hydro-biogeochemistry of Earth's critical zone, stream-groundwater interaction zones, aquatic ecosystem processes, and dynamics at land-atmosphere, land-ocean, and human-natural interfaces. Contributions to this special issue on ``Emergent aquatic carbon-nutrient dynamics as products of hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological interactions'' include papers from authors who attended the workshop and from those who responded to the open solicitation for papers. Our aim in organizing this special issue is to stimulate continued discussion and collaboration across disciplinary boundaries in order to further our collective understanding of aquatic carbon-nutrient dynamics.}
