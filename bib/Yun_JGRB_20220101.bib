 abstract	= {Cold region ecosystems store vast amounts of soil organic carbon (C), which upon warming and decomposition can affect the C balance and potentially change these ecosystems from C sinks to carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) sources. We quantified the decadal year-round CO$_2$ flux from an alpine steppe-ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau using eddy covariance and automatic chamber approaches during a period of significant warming (0.13$^\circ$C per 10 years; and 0.18$^\circ$C in the non-growing season alone: 1st October to next 30th April). The results showed that ongoing climate change, mainly warming within the topsoil layers, is the main reason for the site's change from a sink for to a source of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere. Non-growing-season ecosystem respiration accounted for 51\% of the annual ecosystem respiration and has increased significantly. The growing seasons (1st May to 30th September) were consistent CO$_2$ sink periods without significant changes over the study period. Observations revealed high-emission events from the end of the non-growing season to early in the growing season (1st March to fifteenth May), which significantly ($p < 0.01$) increased at a rate of $22.6$~g\,C\,m$^{-2}$\,decade$^{-1}$, ranging from $14.6 \pm 10.7$~g\,C\,m$^{-2}$\,yr$^{-1}$ in 2012 to $35.3 \pm 12.1$~g\,C\,m$^{-2}$\,yr$^{-1}$ in 2017. Structural equation modeling suggested that active layer warming was the key factor in explaining changes in ecosystem respiration, leading to significant changes in net ecosystem exchange over the period 2011--2020 and indicated that these changes have already transformed the ecosystem from a CO$_2$ sink into a source. These results can be used to improve our understanding of the sensitivity of ecosystem respiration to increased warming during the non-growing period.}
