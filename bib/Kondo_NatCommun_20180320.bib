 abstract	= {An integrated understanding of the biogeochemical consequences of climate extremes and land use changes is needed to constrain land-surface feedbacks to atmospheric CO$_2$ from associated climate change. Past assessments of the global carbon balance have shown particularly high uncertainty in Southeast Asia. Here, we use a combination of model ensembles to show that intensified land use change made Southeast Asia a strong source of CO$_2$ from the 1980s to 1990s, whereas the region was close to carbon neutral in the 2000s due to an enhanced CO$_2$ fertilization effect and absence of moderate-to-strong El Ni{\~{n}}o events. Our findings suggest that despite ongoing deforestation, CO$_2$ emissions were substantially decreased during the 2000s, largely owing to milder climate that restores photosynthetic capacity and suppresses peat and deforestation fire emissions. The occurrence of strong El Ni{\~{n}}o events after 2009 suggests that the region has returned to conditions of increased vulnerability of carbon stocks.}
