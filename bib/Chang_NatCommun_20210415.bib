 abstract	= {Wetland methane (CH$_4$) emissions ($F_{CH_{4}}$) are important in global carbon budgets and climate change assessments. Currently, $F_{CH_{4}}$ projections rely on prescribed static temperature sensitivity that varies among biogeochemical models. Meta-analyses have proposed a consistent $F_{CH_{4}}$ temperature dependence across spatial scales for use in models; however, site-level studies demonstrate that $F_{CH_{4}}$ are often controlled by factors beyond temperature. Here, we evaluate the relationship between $F_{CH_{4}}$ and temperature using observations from the FLUXNET-CH$_4$ database. Measurements collected across the globe show substantial seasonal hysteresis between $F_{CH_{4}}$ and temperature, suggesting larger $F_{CH_{4}}$ sensitivity to temperature later in the frost-free season (about 77\% of site-years). Results derived from a machine-learning model and several regression models highlight the importance of representing the large spatial and temporal variability within site-years and ecosystem types. Mechanistic advancements in biogeochemical model parameterization and detailed measurements in factors modulating CH$_4$ production are thus needed to improve global CH$_4$ budget assessments.}
