 abstract	= {The global terrestrial carbon sink is increasing, offsetting roughly a third of anthropogenic CO$_2$ released into the atmosphere each decade, and thus serving to slow the growth of atmospheric CO$_2$. It has been suggested that a CO$_2$-induced long-term increase in global photosynthesis, a process known as CO$_2$ fertilization, is responsible for a large proportion of the current terrestrial carbon sink. The estimated magnitude of the historic increase in photosynthesis as result of increasing atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations, however, differs by an order of magnitude between long-term proxies and terrestrial biosphere models. Here we quantify the historic effect of CO$_2$ on global photosynthesis by identifying an emergent constraint that combines terrestrial biosphere models with global carbon budget estimates. Our analysis suggests that CO$_2$ fertilization increased global annual photosynthesis by $11.85 \pm 1.4$\%, or $13.98 \pm 1.63$ petagrams carbon (mean $\pm$95\% confidence interval) between 1981 and 2020. Our results help resolve conflicting estimates of the historic sensitivity of global photosynthesis to CO$_2$, and highlight the large impact anthropogenic emissions have had on ecosystems worldwide.}
