 abstract	= {The strength of feedbacks between a changing climate and future CO$_2$ concentrations are uncertain and difficult to predict using Earth System Models (ESMs). We analyzed emission-driven simulations---in which atmospheric CO$_2$ levels were computed prognostically---for historical (1850--2005) and future periods (RCP~8.5 for 2006--2100) produced by 15 ESMs for the Fifth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Comparison of ESM prognostic atmospheric CO$_2$ over the historical period with observations indicated that ESMs, on average, had a small positive bias in predictions of contemporary atmospheric CO$_2$. Weak ocean carbon uptake in many ESMs contributed to this bias, based on comparisons with observations of ocean and atmospheric anthropogenic carbon inventories. We found a significant linear relationship between contemporary atmospheric CO$_2$ biases and future CO$_2$ levels for the multi-model ensemble. We used this relationship to create a contemporary CO$_2$ tuned model (CCTM) estimate of the atmospheric CO$_2$ trajectory for the 21$^\textnormal{st}$ century. The CCTM yielded CO$_2$ estimates of 600 $\pm$ 14 ppm at 2060 and 947 $\pm$ 35 ppm at 2100, which were 21 ppm and 32 ppm below the multi-model mean during these two time periods. Using this emergent constraint approach, the likely ranges of future atmospheric CO$_2$, CO$_2$-induced radiative forcing, and CO$_2$-induced temperature increases for the RCP~8.5 scenario were considerably narrowed compared to estimates from the full ESM ensemble. Our analysis provided evidence that much of the model-to-model variation in projected CO$_2$ during the 21$^\textnormal{st}$ century was tied to biases that existed during the observational era, and that model differences in the representation of concentration--carbon feedbacks and other slowly changing carbon cycle processes appear to be the primary driver of this variability. By improving models to more closely match the long-term time series of CO$_2$ from Mauna Loa, our analysis suggests uncertainties in future climate projections can be reduced.}
