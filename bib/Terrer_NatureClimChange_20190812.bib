 abstract	= {Elevated CO$_2$ (eCO$_2$) experiments provide critical information to quantify the effects of rising CO$_2$ on vegetation. Many eCO$_2$ experiments suggest that nutrient limitations modulate the local magnitude of the eCO$_2$ effect on plant biomass, but the global extent of these limitations has not been empirically quantified, complicating projections of the capacity of plants to take up CO$_2$. Here, we present a data-driven global quantification of the eCO$_2$ effect on biomass based on 138 eCO$_2$ experiments. The strength of CO$_2$ fertilization is primarily driven by nitrogen (N) in $\sim$65\% of global vegetation and by phosphorus (P) in $\sim$25\% of global vegetation, with N- or P-limitation modulated by mycorrhizal association. Our approach suggests that CO$_2$ levels expected by 2100 can potentially enhance plant biomass by $12 \pm 3$\% above current values, equivalent to $59 \pm 13$~PgC. The global-scale response to eCO$_2$ we derive from experiments is similar to past changes in greenness and biomass with rising CO$_2$, suggesting that CO$_2$ will continue to stimulate plant biomass in the future despite the constraining effect of soil nutrients. Our research reconciles conflicting evidence on CO$_2$ fertilization across scales and provides an empirical estimate of the biomass sensitivity to eCO$_2$ that may help to constrain climate projections.}
