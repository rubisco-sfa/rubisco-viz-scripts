 abstract	= {We investigated the influence of site characteristics and soil properties on the chemical composition of organic matter in soils collected from a latitudinal transect across northern cold-region through analysis of diffuse reflectance Fourier transform mid infrared (DRIFT) spectra of bulk soils. The study included 119 soil samples collected from 28 sites including tundra, boreal forest, grassland, and coastal rainforest ecosystems. Organic, mineral, and cryoturbated soil horizons, both seasonally and perennially frozen, representing a variety of depths and edaphic conditions were examined. The amount and chemical composition of organic matter, as well as site and soil properties, exerted a strong influence on the DRIFT spectra. The spectra were highly sensitive to the extent of organic matter decomposition, enabling the ordination of organic (Oi, Oe and Oa) horizons. Differences in absorbance intensity for several spectral bands indicated that Oi horizons contained greater abundance of relatively fresh residues, phenolic-OH compounds, aliphatic compounds, and carbohydrates. In contrast, Oa horizons had a greater presence of amide groups, aromatics, C$=$C bonds, carboxylates and carboxylic acids. Another significant factor differentiating these horizons was the incorporation of clays and silicates into the Oa horizons. Calculated ratios of characteristic spectral bands showed a clear trend of increasing decomposition from Oi to Oe to Oa. The DRIFT spectra were related to many site/soil attributes including land cover type, parent material, and associated factors, such as permafrost presence/absence, drainage class, horizon depth, bulk density, cation exchange capacity, and pH. A single DRIFT spectral band was identified that might be used in future studies to quickly estimate the organic carbon, total nitrogen, and carbon:nitrogen ratios of northern soils. Our results demonstrate that the information contained in DRIFT spectra of soil integrates the quantity and chemical composition of soil organic matter with soil properties and highlights the potential for using this information to assess the degradation state of organic matter stored in northern cold-region soils.}
