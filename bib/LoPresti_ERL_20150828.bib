 abstract	= {International climate mitigation efforts are focused on limiting increase in global mean temperature, which has been shown to be proportional to cumulative CO$_2$ emissions. However, the ability of natural and human systems to successfully adapt to climatic changes depends on both the magnitude and rate of change, the latter of which will depend on how quickly a given level of cumulative emissions occurs. We show that cumulative CO$_2$ emissions of 4620~Gt\,CO$_2$ (reached in 2100 in RCP4.5 and 2057 in RCP8.5) produce globally averaged warming rates that are nearly twice as fast in RCP8.5 than RCP4.5 ($0.34 \pm 0.08$$^\circ$C per decade versus $0.19 \pm 0.05$$^\circ$C per decade, respectively). Similarly, the globally averaged velocity of climate change calculated according to the `nearest equivalent climate' is greater by a factor of $\sim$2 in RCP8.5 than in RCP4.5 ($2.51 \pm 0.67$~km\,yr$^{-1}$ versus $1.32 \pm 0.39$~km\,yr$^{-1}$, respectively), despite equivalent cumulative emissions. These differences in the projected velocity of climate change represent uncertainty for ecosystems that may be unable to adapt to the faster changes. Particularly at risk are boreal forests, of which 48\% are projected to experience rates of change beyond their expected adaptive capacity (i.e. $>$0.3$^\circ$C per decade) in RCP4.5, compared with 95\% in RCP8.5. Thus, the same budget of cumulative carbon emissions may result in critically different impacts on natural and human systems, depending on the amount of time over which that budget is expended.}
