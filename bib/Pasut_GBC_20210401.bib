 abstract	= {Wetlands play a key role in regulating global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but anthropogenic impacts on nutrients may severely alter this balance. Recent assessments indicate that almost 22\% of the global wetland area may be affected by agricultural runoff. In this work, we developed and applied a dynamic mechanistic reaction network model of soil organic matter linking the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S) cycles at $0.5^\circ \times 0.5^\circ$ spatial resolution across the globe. The model was used to estimate GHG emissions and nutrient sequestration rates in wetlands, driven by environmental stressors including N, P, and S fertilization. Wetland annual GHG emissions are estimated to be $136 \pm 12.5$~Tg\,C-CH$_4$, $589 \pm 45.8$~Tg\,C-CO$_2$, and $0.3 \pm 0.04$~Tg\,N-N$_2$O; in contrast, C, N, and S annual sequestration rates are estimated to be $576 \pm 88.1$~Tg\,C, $20 \pm 4.4$~Tg\,N, and $7.4 \pm 0.8$~Tg\,S, between 2000 and 2017. N fertilization inputs were responsible for 13\% N$_2$O emissions in wetlands in the Northern Hemisphere, while tropical wetlands were major reservoirs for C, N, and S. Temperature, net primary productivity, and methanogenic microorganisms exert the major control on GHG emissions. Wetland CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ emissions were found to have a hysteretic relationship with seasonal soil temperature, but not N$_2$O. A global-scale assessment is pivotal for best nutrient management practices, reducing nutrient losses, and controlling gas emissions.}
