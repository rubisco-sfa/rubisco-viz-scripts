 abstract	= {Global warming alters surface water availability (precipitation minus evapotranspiration, $P - E$) and hence freshwater resources. However, the influence of land--atmosphere feedbacks on future $P - E$ changes and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that soil moisture (SM) strongly impacts future $P - E$ changes, especially in drylands, by regulating evapotranspiration and atmospheric moisture inflow. Using modelling and empirical approaches, we find a consistent negative SM feedback on $P - E$, which may offset $\sim$60\% of the decline in dryland $P - E$ otherwise expected in the absence of SM feedbacks. The negative feedback is not caused by atmospheric thermodynamic responses to declining SM; rather, reduced SM, in addition to limiting evapotranspiration, regulates atmospheric circulation and vertical ascent to enhance moisture transport into drylands. This SM effect is a large source of uncertainty in projected dryland $P - E$ changes, underscoring the need to better constrain future SM changes and improve the representation of SM--atmosphere processes in models.}
